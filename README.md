# RAJJ- Software Development 1 Website



## Description

As part of our Software Development I course with Dr. Anca Doloc-Mihu, we have been working on our Software Development 1 website. Our website will include a home page that displays Software Development projects made by students who have completed the course. The website will include many different tabs that will include information on the team members of each project, a discussion board/Blog and a FAQ page. There will be an Administrator log, that will allow them to maintain and upload the projects that will be displayed on the website.
